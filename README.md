# LLVM Compiler Infrastructure - Pathogen Fork

This fork adds functionality to libclang to dump the memory layout of records (IE: structs, classes, and unions.) It is currently based on [LLVM 10.0.0](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/d32170dbd5b0d54436537b6b75beaf44324e0c28).

Essentially it exposes information provided by `ASTRecordLayout` and `MicrosoftVTableContext`/`ItaniumVTableContext`.
Both sets of information are intended to be ABI-agnostic.

The information provided for record layouts is largely based on the behavior of the `-fdump-record-layouts` switch.

The information provided for vtable layouts is somewhat based on the bahvior of the `-fdump-vtable-layouts` switch, but the implementation of this switch for Itanium and Microsoft ABIs is basically completely separate (the information provided by each isn't even consistent.) The codebase meant to be processed by this fork never has multiple inheritance or virtual bases, so it may be lacking in information in that department.

This fork also provides a function `pathogen_Location_isFromMainFile`, which has slightly different behavior compared to `clang_Location_isFromMainFile`. (It uses `SourceManager::isInMainFile` instead of `SourceManager::isWrittenInMainFile`.) The main difference we care about is this function will consider locations from cursors that were expanded from macros in the main file to be in the main file.

This fork isn't really ever meant to be merged into libclang proper. It's all contained in one file, the only modification to existing files is to add the new file to cmake. If someone wanted to adapt it to use proper formatting and and API shape to merge with libclang that'd be pretty cool. (However I find it unlikely they'd want to merge the vtable stuff unless it was modified to be more complete.)

Our use case for this fork was for C# via [ClangSharp](https://github.com/microsoft/clangsharp), hence the lack of header file. The C# bindings are not included in this repo, but they can be provided upon request.

# The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure

This directory and its sub-directories contain source code for LLVM,
a toolkit for the construction of highly optimized compilers,
optimizers, and run-time environments.

The README briefly describes how to get started with building LLVM.
For more information on how to contribute to the LLVM project, please
take a look at the
[Contributing to LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html) guide.

## Getting Started with the LLVM System

Taken from https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html.

### Overview

Welcome to the LLVM project!

The LLVM project has multiple components. The core of the project is
itself called "LLVM". This contains all of the tools, libraries, and header
files needed to process intermediate representations and convert them into
object files.  Tools include an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and
bitcode optimizer.  It also contains basic regression tests.

C-like languages use the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) front end.  This
component compiles C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ code into LLVM bitcode
-- and from there into object files, using LLVM.

Other components include:
the [libc++ C++ standard library](https://libcxx.llvm.org),
the [LLD linker](https://lld.llvm.org), and more.

### Getting the Source Code and Building LLVM

The LLVM Getting Started documentation may be out of date.  The [Clang
Getting Started](http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) page might have more
accurate information.

This is an example work-flow and configuration to get and build the LLVM source:

1. Checkout LLVM (including related sub-projects like Clang):

     * ``git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git``

     * Or, on windows, ``git clone --config core.autocrlf=false
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git``

2. Configure and build LLVM and Clang:

     * ``cd llvm-project``

     * ``cmake -S llvm -B build -G <generator> [options]``

        Some common build system generators are:

        * ``Ninja`` --- for generating [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)
          build files. Most llvm developers use Ninja.
        * ``Unix Makefiles`` --- for generating make-compatible parallel makefiles.
        * ``Visual Studio`` --- for generating Visual Studio projects and
          solutions.
        * ``Xcode`` --- for generating Xcode projects.

        Some common options:

        * ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS='...'`` and ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES='...'`` ---
          semicolon-separated list of the LLVM sub-projects and runtimes you'd like to
          additionally build. ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` can include any of: clang,
          clang-tools-extra, cross-project-tests, flang, libc, libclc, lld, lldb,
          mlir, openmp, polly, or pstl. ``LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES`` can include any of
          libcxx, libcxxabi, libunwind, compiler-rt, libc or openmp. Some runtime
          projects can be specified either in ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` or in
          ``LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES``.

          For example, to build LLVM, Clang, libcxx, and libcxxabi, use
          ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES="libcxx;libcxxabi"``.

        * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=directory`` --- Specify for *directory* the full
          path name of where you want the LLVM tools and libraries to be installed
          (default ``/usr/local``). Be careful if you install runtime libraries: if
          your system uses those provided by LLVM (like libc++ or libc++abi), you
          must not overwrite your system's copy of those libraries, since that
          could render your system unusable. In general, using something like
          ``/usr`` is not advised, but ``/usr/local`` is fine.

        * ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=type`` --- Valid options for *type* are Debug,
          Release, RelWithDebInfo, and MinSizeRel. Default is Debug.

        * ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On`` --- Compile with assertion checks enabled
          (default is Yes for Debug builds, No for all other build types).

      * ``cmake --build build [-- [options] <target>]`` or your build system specified above
        directly.

        * The default target (i.e. ``ninja`` or ``make``) will build all of LLVM.

        * The ``check-all`` target (i.e. ``ninja check-all``) will run the
          regression tests to ensure everything is in working order.

        * CMake will generate targets for each tool and library, and most
          LLVM sub-projects generate their own ``check-<project>`` target.

        * Running a serial build will be **slow**.  To improve speed, try running a
          parallel build.  That's done by default in Ninja; for ``make``, use the option
          ``-j NNN``, where ``NNN`` is the number of parallel jobs, e.g. the number of
          CPUs you have.

      * For more information see [CMake](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html)
